Smash some but not all of the tomatoes with the back of a wooden spoon to help create a sauce, then continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until a chunky, thickened sauce comes together and about half the tomatoes are completely broken down and half remain in tact, 10–12 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding sugar if sauce seems tart. Pluck out and discard basil sprigs.",
      "Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain pasta, add to pot with sauce, and cook over medium heat, stirring, until coated, 1–2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 oz. Parmesan.",
      "Divide pasta among bowls. Top with more Parmesan and 1 cup basil leaves. Drizzle with oil."

      "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the oil is shimmering. Add the tofu and fry on until golden brown on each side (about 3 minutes each side). Remove the fried tofu from the pan and turn the heat down to low. While the tofu fries, cut the mango into cubes.",

Once hot, add oil, and once the oil is hot, add the onion, garlic, jalapeño, and bell pepper and cook until the the ingredients begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cumin, smaller amount of chili powder, and tomato paste, and cook for 1 minute. Add diced tomatoes and let simmer for 1 minute, then add the beans and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Taste the mixture and add salt; I find I need between 2 to 3 teaspoons kosher salt to get the level right but adjust it to your taste. Add last 1 teaspoon chili powder if needed for your desired heat level. Add the corn and spinach and stir until the spinach has wilted and everything is warm. Taste for seasoning again and adjust as needed.",
      "Remove from heat and squeeze the juice of half the lime over the mixture, then the second half if you like more. Let cool slightly while you get ready to assemble your burritos.",
      "Assemble your burritos: If your tortillas are unbendy from the package, you can warm them briefly in a dry skillet or for 15 seconds in the microwave to soften them. If they seem dry, I might spritz them lightly with water before warming.",
      "Arrange first tortilla on counter and spoon about 3/4 cup of the filling in the lower third, closest to you. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup jack cheese and 2 tablespoons cotija. (If you like to make some burritos spicier than others, you can shake hot sauce on at this point.) Fold the bottom of the tortilla over the filling, fold in the sides, and roll it up, setting it to cool seam side-down. Repeat with remaining tortillas, filling, and cheese.",
      "To eat right away: Go for it! but I love to brown it in a pan on both sides for some added texture and to ensure the cheese gets melty. Heat a skillet with a thin layer of oil over medium heat and add burritos you're ready to eat. Cook until browned and crisp on both sides and dig in.",
      "To freeze for later: Wrap burritos individually in foil (best for oven reheating) or plastic and pack in a freezer bag with all air pressed out. Burritos keep in the freezer a few months, or for as long as your freezer allows them to without imparting a 'freezery' taste.",
      "To reheat from frozen in an oven: Heat oven to 375°F. Heat foil-wrapped burrito for 40 to 50 minutes. To check for warmth, stick a toothpick or skewer into the center of a burrito and keep it there for 10 seconds. If the toothpick is warm when it's remove, the burrito is too. If not, give it more time.",
      "To reheat from frozen in a microwave: Unwrap burrito and microwave on a plate for 3 to 5 minutes, turning over once midway. To check for warmth, stick a toothpick or skewer into the center of a burrito and keep it there for 10 seconds. If the toothpick is warm when it's remove, the burrito is too. If not, give it more time.",

    "notes": [
      "Chili powders tend to range a lot in heat level so give it a taste before you start to make sure you're not surprised after adding the first 2 teaspoons.",
      "Depending on the size of my tortillas, I sometimes end up with 1 to 1.5 cups extra filling. You can use it to make more burritos or just heat it up with extra cheese and put an egg on top, and I did with delight last week."

      "Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes.",
      "Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 3-4 minutes (for a visual, watch me do it in the video above!). The dough can be a little too heavy for a mixer to knead it, but you can certainly use the mixer on low speed instead. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger – if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.",
      "Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray– just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150°F (66°C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it's doubled in size, remove from the oven.)",
      "Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza. Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor. Highly recommended.",
      "Shape the dough: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. (If not making 2 pizzas, freeze half of the dough for another time– see freezing instructions below.) On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle. Lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. I simply pinch the edges up to create the rim. If using a pizza stone, place the dough directly on baker's peels dusted with cornmeal.",
      "Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you prepare your pizza toppings. I suggest pepperoni & green peppers or jalapeño slices, extra cheese pizza, Hawaiian pizza, classic margherita pizza, spinach artichoke white pizza, or homemade BBQ chicken pizza.",
      "Top & bake the pizza: To prevent the filling from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the top lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 12-15 minutes.",
      "Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: This recipe yields two 12-inch pizzas. After the pizza dough rises and you divide the dough in half (step 5), you can freeze one of the balls of dough to make pizza at a later time. Or you can simply freeze both balls of dough separately. Lightly coat all sides of the dough ball(s) with nonstick spray or olive oil. Place the dough ball(s) into individual zipped-top bag(s) and seal tightly, squeezing out all the air. Freeze for up to 3 months. To thaw, place the frozen pizza dough in the refrigerator for about 8 hours or overnight. When ready to make pizza, remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow to rest for 30 minutes on the counter. Continue with step 5.",
      "Overnight/All Day Instructions: Prepare the dough through step 3, but allow the dough to rise for 8-12 hours in the refrigerator. (If it needs to be in the refrigerator for longer, use cooler water in the dough which will slow the dough's rise and allow for more time.) The slow rise gives the pizza dough wonderful flavor! When ready, continue with step 5. If the dough didn't quite double in size overnight, let it sit at room temperature for 30-45 minutes before punching down (step 5)."

Adjust seasoning to taste. (As always, that is the most important part of making a dressing — my perfect dressing is not the same as yours! Add more vinegar to make it more acidic, more honey to make it sweeter, more oil to make it thicker and less acidic, more salt to make the flavors pop, etc.) Dressing will keep in the fridge for up to 10 days.",
      "To make the quinoa, add 1 cup uncooked quinoa and 1 1/2 cups water (or any kind of stock) to a small pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low heat, cover, and cook for 13 to 15 minutes, until all of the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from heat but keep the lid on for an additional 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. You'll use 2 cups of COOKED quinoa in this recipe and have about a cup left over. Let the leftovers cool completely then store them in an airtight container in the fridge for later use this week (see notes for ideas).",
      "Add 16 ounces chopped kale to a large bowl and season with a big pinch of salt and pepper. Use your hands to massage the kale until it JUST starts to feel damp — so squeeze it between your fists about 10 times. If you come across any pieces of thick stem while you're massaging, discard them.",
      "Now let's tackle that rotisserie chicken. Pull the thighs/legs and wings off, store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container, and use them for another meal within 4 days. Pull the breast meat off (I discard the skin but you can shred it in with the meat if you'd like!), shred it finely, and add the meat right on top of the kale. Add 2 cups cooked quinoa, 1 bag shredded carrots, 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 cup golden raisins, and your desired amount of dressing. (If I'm cooking this salad for dinner/to serve immediately, I use almost all of the dressing, about 1/3 cup! If I'm meal prepping it for lunches, I go lighter with the dressing initially then add a little more to each serving when I'm ready to eat it.)",
      "Toss to combine. Add more dressing as needed until your greens are coated to your liking. Divide the salad between four to six bowls, and garnish with more Parm and a sprinkle of chopped nuts. I love lemon so much that I serve each serving of salad with a lemon wedge for squeezing over top!",
      "(PS, I add the nuts at the end so that they don't go into the big salad and get soggy in the fridge, but this is personal preference!)"

      "To cook rice in an InstantPot: Use 1 1/2 cups rice, 1 can coconut milk, but only 1/2 cup water. Cook for 5 minutes (along with the other ingredients), then allow the pressure to naturally release for 10 minutes. I love cooking rice in the IP!",
      "Gimme some greens: Add steamed spinach! Once the time is up on the rice, stir it, then add three big handfuls of spinach right on top, cover, and let it sit for 10 minutes. It'll steam in the residual heat!",
      "Oh, another greens addition idea! Finely chop a few handfuls of any dark leafy green — spinach, kale, chard — and stir it into the beef while cooking it.",
      "My current hyper-fixation salad would be great on the side if you want to bulk this up: Cucumber, pepper, avocado salad.",
      "Save time: Use steam-in-bag frozen rice instead of making coconut rice.",
      "Feeding kids: You can leave the sriracha out of the sauce! Just add sriracha to the table and let people who like spice drizzle it on their bowls.",
      "Make ahead: The Thai basil beef, coconut rice, and peanut sauce can all be cooked up to 3 days ahead of when you plan to eat! Store them separately in airtight containers in the fridge. The peanut sauce will thicken as it sits — stir in splashes of warm water to loosen it up before serving. Reheat the beef and rice on the stovetop, in the oven (in any oven-safe dish for a few minutes at 300°F until warm), or in the microwave.",
      "Freezer-friendly: Both the rice and beef freeze beautifully for up to 3 months! In both cases, let the dish cool completely then transfer leftovers to a Ziploc bag (either one gallon-size bag or multiple smaller bags). To reheat frozen rice, chip off however much you want to eat and add it to a microwave-safe bowl. Top the bowl with plastic wrap or a reusable, microwave-safe lid or plate. Microwave for 2 to 3 minutes, or until warmed through. Careful when you're taking the top off — there will be steam! For the beef, let it thaw overnight in the fridge then reheat it. Doubling the beef to freeze half would be a very good idea!",
      "Love your leftovers: Leftover beef and rice will be good for up to 3 days stored in the fridge. With them, you could make lettuce wraps, filling leaves of Bibb, iceberg, or little gem lettuce with leftover beef, rice, kimchi, and toppings! Drizzle with leftover peanut sauce! Leftover peanut sauce would also be good on any roasted veggies (I LOVE it on roasted broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower), and will keep in the fridge for at least a week.",
      "Dairy-free/gluten-free/nut-free: It's already dairy free! To avoid gluten, use tamari or coconut aminos instead of soy sauce. To avoid nuts, use a seed butter like sunflower butter or tahini and choose your toppings carefully!",
      "Vegetarian: Swap the beef for a plant-based ground meat alternative. Or tofu! Make crispy tofu however you like to make it. One idea: squeeze out as much moisture as possible over the sink. Heat 2 tbsp oil over high heat. Crumble the tofu in and cook until crispy. Then add all of the same sauces that I added to the beef!",
      "Jasmine rice: Any kind of white rice will work! Brown rice would work too but you'll need to increase the water to 1 1/2 cups as well as the cook time (check the bag of your rice for exact time).",
      "Coconut milk: Coconut cream will also work, or omit and cook with all water if you can't find coconut milk."

Scooch everything over to one half of the skillet. Warm the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the other empty half of the skillet and add 1 pound ground chicken. Let the chicken cook for 2 to 3 minutes undisturbed, then start flipping and stirring it, using a spatula to break the chicken up into tiny pieces as it cooks — no big chunks allowed. Continue stirring the cabbage occasionally as you cook the chicken.",
      "Once the chicken is cooked through (after about 8 to 10 minutes), stir it together with the cabbage. If there is still liquid in the skillet, crank the heat up to high and keep stirring until it's all evaporated.",

      "Cook on medium-high for 3 to 5 minutes, until the liquid has thickened and is clinging to the chicken and vegetables. If it's still really liquidy after 5 minutes, crank the heat up to high, stir frequently, and it'll thicken up quickly. As always, taste and adjust seasonings until it's perfect (you could add a pinch or two more salt if the flavors need to pop more, some lime juice or more vinegar for extra tang, honey for more sweetness, sriracha for spice, etc.!).",
      "Serve over rice, if you'd like, or just by itself! Garnish with sriracha, peanuts, and sesame seeds to make it look less like beige slop, but either way, who cares, it's delicious!"

Add a little oil to the pan and place the tofu pieces with enough space between each so that they're not too crowded, working in batches if necessary. Without moving the tofu slices around too much, let them cook for a few minutes per side until they're deeply golden brown and caramelized around the edges. Remove from heat and season to taste.",

      "For seared tofu, I like to use West Soy Extra Firm Tofu. I find it to be a bit less watery (and easier to work with) than other brands of firm tofu.",
      "For the pickled veggies: if you can't find daikon, use a few red radishes or just skip it. If you're sensitive to spice, go light on the jalapeños.",
      "Other ideas: add sautéed shiitake mushrooms or slices of avocado."
